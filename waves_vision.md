what I'm thinking here: create a circle, put some extra control points on it (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPJo1jayLdc) for how to do this), and then create a variation of that circle, smaller, inside. Perhaps twice or three times, or more. For each set of corresponding points through the variations, fit a polynomial and interpolate between layers using those polynomials. Laser cut, and voila.
